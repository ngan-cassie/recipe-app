# RECIPE WEB APP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Frontend

- Library: React.js, React Router DOM, Firebase
- Functions to render UI can be found at: /src/Services.js

## Backend

- Database: Google Firestore Database
- I used Apps Script editor to scrape recipe data from Google Spreadsheet and push it to Firestore.
